# Code of Conduct
**TL;DR.** Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated at Hackofiesta. Women Safety is one of our most important priorities and any case reported will be dealt with strictly, and might include informing police authorities for the same. We expect a cheerful and friendly environment here at Hackofiesta.

Hackofiesta stands for inclusivity.  We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.  

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organisers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, Hackofiesta Team may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Hackofiesta Team using the reporting procedures defined below.

Hackofiesta Team will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the Hackofiesta Venue, online interactions in relation to the event, or Hackofiesta related social events.
